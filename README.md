### Why did I make Taco Cat, again...?

Because this time it's built with ASP.NET Core MVC and I actually used a custom model to model the data.

### The live site

The site is not live because it has not been hosted and/or deployed anywhere.

### Download

`git clone https://github.com/mackenzieweaver/TacocatWCustomModel`
